% Notes on kinect calibration

Some authors declare a kinect calibration an important issue. like:

I have calibrated the rgb camera succesfully. Try to generate a pattern visible for depth camera but discontinuities appear in edges.

I try calibration toolbox from Herrera2012 (Joint depth and color camera calibration with distortion correction) and from now no good results
I did only with kinect, but the autor uses another camera with it.

I think than openni calibration of R and t is enough to work. A further improvement in depth can be viewed with a plane and ransac approach to see depth. 
But this experiment will depended on my measurement from camera which I consider it is no acurate.

Kinect model error from Nguyen2012 can be added to ICP to camera pose estimation.
